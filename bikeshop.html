				<h2 class= "problem-subtitle">What's the Problem</h2>

				<p>
				A significant number of individuals seeking to purchase a new bicycle often struggle to determine the most suitable option for their needs, primarily due the lack of knowledge, information, and guidance available to them.
				</p>
			</div>	  
			<div class="col">	
				<h2 class= "problem-subtitle">The Goal</h2>
				<p>
				Our priority is to provide comprehensive support to users in their search for the perfect bicycle by addressing any needs or uncertainties they may have about the product. To fulfill this objective, I have developed a live chat assistance feature wherein a dedicated team member is available to promptly respond to user inquiries and provide personalized guidance throughout their purchasing journey.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col">

				<h2 class= "problem-subtitle">The Challenge</h2>

				<p>
				Since this was my first UX Design project the whole process was a considerable challenge, including various aspects, from exploring the best ways to gather valuable insights to understand the common challenges people face when choosing and purchasing a bike, to introducing myself with Figma as a wireframing and prototyping tool, and even conducting usability testing. Each step presented an exciting and a unique learning opportunity.

			<p class="">To identify users paint points I have created a survey with specific questions about the challenges that people face at the moment of purchasing a bike. I utilized social media platforms, where I found a receptive and enthusiastic group of participants who generously shared their insights and experiences by willingly responding to the survey. </p>

				<p>My design process started with sketching paper wireframeson, capturing all the immediate ideas that surfaced while contemplating potential solutions. Then, I transitioned to Figma for the development of digital wireframes. Connecting these screens and buttons within the platform facilitated the creation of low-fidelity prototypes.

				<h1 class="main-title ">Usability Study Low Fidelity Prototype</h1>
				<p>Once I had my low fidelity prototype I was ready to conduct a usability study. I started by creating a note-taking spreadsheet in which I added some tasks and questions for my participants to analyze how easy is for them to complete the assigned tasks and discover  possible problems in the user flow,, being specially focus on the checking out process. 
				</p>
				<p>I have conducted this usability study  with five participants through Zoom with the permission of being recorded.

				<h2>Insights</h2>

					</div>
				</div>
				
				
				<h2>Unable to add more than item to the shopping cart</h2>
				<p>Participants were unable of select more than one item to the shopping cart. Even though I have created another wireframe where people can add more items, this particular problem should be fixed later when coding for a better user experience.</p>
				<img src="images/insight-bike-1.jpg" class="img">
				
				<h2>An Order Confirmation page is demanded</h2>
				<p>Participants want to see an Order Confirmation page before procced to the payment and be able to see all the information of their purchases and summary of their order</p>
				<img src="images/insight-bike-2.jpg" class="img">
				
				<h2>Unable to see the sum of all items selected</h2>
				<p>Participants could not see the summary of the items before or during the check out process. I have added a special button to solve the user flow when checking out that says "Show Order Summary" so they can have that information until procced to the payment.</p>
				<img src="images/insight-bike-3.jpg" class="img">
				
				<h2>No existence of a number on the basket button</h2>
				<p>Most participants wanted to see the number of items selected on the basket button. Based on this insight I made a few changes and when users click on " Add to cart" button, immediately appear a "thank you" message and a number of the total items on the basket.</p>

				<p>Following adjustments informed by the initial usability study, I proceeded to develop high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes.

				<p>During the initial Usability Study, I was mainly checking out how smoothly users could move through the app and addressing any bumps in the road during the checkout process. This time, my goal was to make sure that all the modifications I made actually worked well and were user-friendly. Plus, I wanted to see if the new Chat assistance and "Help me choose" options I added were doing their job in fixing the issues we had in order to solve the actual problem.</p>
			
				<h2>Users don't find accessible to have the "Help me choose"<br> and "Start Chat" button in the same screen</h2>
				<p class="align-center">Most participants want to have the " Help me choose" option separated from the chat assistance.</p>

				<p class="align-center">I have updated the design in a way that both options were more reachable and less confusing for users to use. </p>
