		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Lingo-Journey is an  App and Responsive Website that allow users have the possibility of connecting with natives speakers of the language they are learning  through chat and video call. People can also start learning a new language from the Alphabet. Additionally they can learn by choosing a specific topic and dive into it not matter what level they are. Besides, it has  a search bar to look for words that they must not know.</p>
		</div>



		<div class="three-col">
			<div class="col">
				<h2 class= "problem-subtitle">What's the Problem</h2>

				<li>There is no App or Website that start teaching languages from the Alphabet.</li>
				<li>Lack of conversational skills or not having the opportunity to speak often.</li>

				<h2 class= "problem-subtitle">Solutions</h2>

			<h1 class="main-title ">User Research</h1>
			<p>I used Google forms to develop a questionnaire and then I published it on social media and in Survey Circle to reach my audience. I also send it to some friends that already were in the process of learning a new language. </p>
			<p>80% of people who answered my survey had already used an App to learn a foreign language, most of them have tried Duolingo and they also mention a few other Apps such as Babbel, Rosetta Stone or Busuu.</p>
			<p>The feedback received through research made it very clear that there is not App or website that start teaching a language from the Alphabet which is basic to identify new letters, sounds and pronunciation that doesn’t exist in their original language. 
			</p>
			<p>The other problem I found was the lack of speaking practice, the big challenge comes when they face the real world situation and they feel embarrassed about their pronunciation when speaking.</p>
			<div class="research-questions">
				<p>1- Would you use an App or website to learn a language?
				</p>
				<p>2- Have you ever used an App or website to learn a language? Which one?  Can you describe briefly your experience using the App?
				</p>
				<p>3- How many languages have you tried to learn and which ones?
				</p>
				<p>4- What motivates you to learn a new language? 
				</p>
				<p>5- What frustrates you the most when trying to learn a new language? Is there any way in which you feel you can resolve these challenges?
				</p>6- What features would you like to have in a learning language App or website? Select all apply.
					<li>A search bar to look for a specific word or phrase that would you like to learn in your interested language</li>
					<li>Presentation</li>
					<li>Most common verbs</li>
					<li>Gramma</li>
					<li>Writing practice</li>
					<li>Reading practice</li>
					<li>Speaking practice</li>
					<li>Chat with your pears (find a native speaker to talk)</li>
					<li>Learn words and phrases by specific topic such as, sports, music, clothes, animals, restaurants, travel, cooking and more.</li>
					<li>Alphabet</li>
					<li>Other</li>
				<p>7- Have you ever had the opportunity of practice any language in the real world environment?
				</p>
				<p>8- Do you have any suggestion about what would you like to have in a learning language App or website based on your needs?

			<p class="">Next I have compared 3 direct competitors (Duolingo, Babbel and Mondly) and one indirect competitor (Italki) to find out direction on gaps and opportunities to address on my personal product design.</p>
			<p>I have confirmed that none of my direct competitors offer to learn a language starting from the alphabet, neither give the opportunity to users to have a real conversation practice. </p>
			<p>While my indirect competitor does offer real conversational practice  by choosing and paying a teacher, it's not specially good at given users the opportunity of having a real conversation with other partners. </p>
			<p>Those insights brings me a great opportunity to solve people problems on my design.</p>
